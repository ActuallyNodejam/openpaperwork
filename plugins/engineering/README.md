# OpenPaperwork Engineering

requirements specifications with numbered shall statements, verification and SI units, with a check that flags vague words.

| Pack | What it is for |
| --- | --- |
| `skills/requirements-spec` | Requirements specification (kravspecifikation) as Word, English or Swedish |
| `skills/_checks`, `skills/_shared` | The check modules and shared code these packs import; not skills |

## Workflows

Start one by typing its command in Claude Code in the folder that holds your files, alone or with one
line after it. It runs in one go and hands back the file, then says what is still open for you.

| Workflow, started by its command | What you get | What to give it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/openpaperwork-engineering:requirements` | A requirements specification in Word with numbered shall statements and verification | Drop your notes or say what is to be built |

Install it in Claude Code with `/plugin install openpaperwork-engineering@openpaperwork` after
`/plugin marketplace add`, or start Claude Code with `claude --plugin-dir` pointing at this folder.
Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Kiro and VS Code read `plugin.json` here (Agent Plugins 1.0.0). It needs
Python 3.10 or later with `pip install -r requirements.txt`; in Claude Code the plugin sets that
up itself, once, at the first session start. A clean run ends with `pack check clean`.

Every file here is a copy of `skills/` in the OpenPaperwork repository, built by
`python3 scripts/build-portable-pack.py`; change the source there, never here.
